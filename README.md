# Umami_TD 

Umami_TD is a software tool designed for predicting whether short peptides of 2-4 amino acids in length possess umami taste. The "TD" stands for tetrapeptide docking, indicating the underlying mechanism used for prediction. Umami_TD is capable of analyzing multiple peptide sequences simultaneously, providing users with quick and convenient predictions.

## Features

- Predicts umami taste potential of 2-4 amino acid length peptides.
- Supports batch processing of multiple peptide sequences.
- Provides rapid prediction results.

## Versions

Umami_TD comes in two versions:

1. **Java Version**: Requires Java JDK environment for execution (Ensure Java JDK environment is installed on your system. You can download it from Oracle's official website.).
2. **Windows Installer Version**: Comes with an installer for easy installation on Windows operating systems.

## Usage

### Java Version

To use the Java version of Umami_TD:

1. Ensure Java JDK environment is installed on your system.
2. Download the repository.
3. Run the Java executable file, passing the peptide sequences as input.

### Windows Installer Version

To use the Windows Installer version:

1. Download the installer from the repository.
2. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
3. Once installed, launch Umami_TD from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.
4. Input peptide sequences directly into the application interface.

## Input Format

Peptide sequences should be provided as input, separated by spaces or commas.

Example:
```
AMER LGD AR
```

## Output

Umami_TD will generate prediction results for each input peptide sequence, indicating whether they are predicted to possess umami taste.
